The To-Do Web App is a simple and responsive web application that allows users to add, delete, and manage daily tasks. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it helps users stay organized by maintaining a list of tasks they need to complete. The tasks are stored in the browser using local Storage, so the list remains even after refreshing the page.
